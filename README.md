# UFOs
Dana asked for our help to create a webpage to filter UFO sightings by criteria. The criteria she would like to add are city, state, country, and shape of the UFO. To do this we need to update our HTML and JavaScript files. 
### Search Filters
The search filters make it really simple to perform a search. If you want to see if there was a ufo sighting in your city, you would use the city filter. 
The biggest drawback of the webpage is that the search filter is case sensitive. Not everyone might realize that right away and it can cause some issues for the less tech savvy. 
### Improvements I Would Make
Having an interactive website where someone can create an account and upload their own sightings would create a better user experience. Another recommendation for the website I would suggest is adding articles to the front page of directly filtering sightings. It would create a potentially more popular site for people to want to visit.
